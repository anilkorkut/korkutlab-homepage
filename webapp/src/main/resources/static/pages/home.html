About
Based in the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, we are a basic science group aiming to transform cancer treatment. Our research interests cover a variaety of major problems in cancer biology and targeted therapies. We particularly study resistance to targeted therapies in cancer using a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. We are always looking to work with talented people with skills in computational biology, statistics, machine learning, systems biology and cell biology.

Research
We are most interested in response and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer. Targeted agents interfere with activities of individual target molecules to inhibit specific hallmarks of cancer. However, resistance to targeted agents emerges in almost all therapies. We are developing and applying quantitative biology methods to understand mechanisms of drug resistance and discover combination therapies to overcome (or forestall) the resistance. We combine computational modeling and perturbation experiments. We use our in house network pharmacology methods, pathway analysis, machine learning algorithms and statistics to predict response how cancer cells response to untested targeted perturbations.  In the wet lab, we generate drug response data sets to be used as constraints in our modeling studies and, eventually, validate our predictions from the models (predictions on signaling mechanisms and drug response).
